zlib ??

for some reason needed aux_util and aux_vive to worky. disturbing.

don't really care about how to get hand tracking models, just needs to work.

todo:
figure out why aux_vive requires zlib, remove if necessary

figure out how to not compile psvr/psmv/t_kalman along with rest of aux_tracking. make an aux_tracking_psmv?
make those depend on if the psmv driver is active?

steamvr.vrsettings unnecessary

/mnt/c/Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win64/vrpathreg.exe

"Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win64/vrpathreg.exe"

vrpathreg may not have been enough - might need

```
	"external_drivers" : 
	[
		C:\dev\ht_windows_steamvr_2\out\build\x64-Debug\steamvr-monado\"
	],
```

in openvrpaths.vrpath

oh wait no vrpathreg added that for us :P hmm yep it 10% did

ok so.... wat?

okay so:
You get cryptic "the program was unable to start" or something errors if onnxruntime.dll isn't present either on the machine or in the install dir. I think you can just do CRIMES and copy it

StereoKit reveals this issue that the hand joint sizes are totally wrong

vcpkg in manifest mode solved so many problems
pwsh scripts were good
bleh





flow:

One `MercuryHandDevice` per hand.

??? creation stuff
DeviceProvider::Init:
    uses Get/CreateHMDConfig which uses lighthouse_console.exe and saves it to ...some internal path, who cares, then loads it using std::ifstream. Very good.
     creates: DeviceProvider::HandTrackingThread using std::thread
DeviceProvider::HandTrackingThread



without pretending to be index controllers:
the hand's forward axis seems to be my wrist's +Z, so totally backwards. the thumb seems to be closer, when my back of my hand is facing me/the camera, and the palms are both facing out. 
with pretending to be index controllers: literally no difference afaict
