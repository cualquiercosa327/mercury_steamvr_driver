Convo with ChatGPT about this:

I have a pretty odd question: do you have in your training data anything about Windows DirectShow for webcams?

Yes, I do have information in my training data about Windows DirectShow for webcams. DirectShow is a multimedia framework and API developed by Microsoft for handling media files and streams, and it includes support for webcams and other video capture devices.

DirectShow has been around for many years and has been used in a variety of applications, including web conferencing, video editing software, and video capture software. The framework includes a set of interfaces and components for managing video capture devices, processing video data, and displaying video on screen.

If you have more specific questions about using DirectShow with webcams, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to provide an answer based on my training data.

Awesome! So I'm doing stuff mainly based on Theodore Watson's videoInput stuff. I'm mainly trying to figure out if there's a reasonable way to get timestamps along with each image frame, somehow. Right now I'm not super hopeful but maybe you know something?

Yes, it's definitely possible to get timestamps along with each image frame using DirectShow. DirectShow provides a way to query the timestamp for each frame captured by a video device.

The video capture filter in DirectShow has an output pin that produces video frames. You can obtain a reference to this output pin and then use the IMediaSeeking interface to query the current position (which is the current timestamp) of the video stream.

Here is some sample code in C++ that shows how to get the current timestamp of each captured frame using DirectShow:

```cpp

// Assume that we have a capture graph and a video device filter
IBaseFilter* pDeviceFilter = ...; // Video capture device filter
IGraphBuilder* pGraphBuilder = ...; // Graph builder

// Connect the video capture device to the capture graph
pGraphBuilder->AddFilter(pDeviceFilter, L"Video Capture");
...

// Get the output pin of the video capture filter
IPin* pCaptureOutputPin = ...; // Output pin of the video capture filter
...

// Get the IMediaSeeking interface of the capture output pin
IMediaSeeking* pMediaSeeking = nullptr;
pCaptureOutputPin->QueryInterface(IID_IMediaSeeking, (void**)&pMediaSeeking);

// Set the time format to reference time (100 nanosecond units)
pMediaSeeking->SetTimeFormat(&TIME_FORMAT_MEDIA_TIME);

// Start the video capture graph
pMediaControl->Run();

// Capture video frames and get the timestamp for each frame
IMediaSample* pSample = nullptr;
while (true)
{
    // Get the next video frame
    pCaptureOutputPin->ConnectionMediaType(&mt);
    pSampleGrabber->GetCurrentBuffer(&cbBuffer, (BYTE*) pBuffer);
    pCaptureOutputPin->Receive(pSample);

    // Get the current timestamp of the video frame
    LONGLONG llTimestamp;
    pMediaSeeking->GetCurrentPosition(&llTimestamp);

    // Use the timestamp and the video frame to do whatever you want
    ...

    // Release the sample
    pSample->Release();
}
```

In this code, pCaptureOutputPin is the output pin of the video capture filter, and pMediaSeeking is the IMediaSeeking interface obtained from the output pin. Once you have the IMediaSeeking interface, you can set the time format to reference time (100 nanosecond units), and then use the GetCurrentPosition method to get the current timestamp of each video frame.

Note that this code is just a sample, and there may be additional steps required to set up the DirectShow graph and configure the video device. But hopefully this gives you an idea of how to get timestamps along with each image frame using DirectShow.

Thank you so much, this is amazing! 

You're welcome! I'm glad I could help. If you have any more questions, don't hesitate to ask.

Oh another question: do you have any idea how we could get the timestamp relative to QueryPerformanceCounter's reference frame?

Yes, you can convert the DirectShow timestamp, which is based on the reference time (100 nanosecond units), to the QueryPerformanceCounter timestamp using the QueryPerformanceCounter function and the QueryPerformanceFrequency function.

Here's how you can do the conversion in C++:

cpp

LARGE_INTEGER qwTimeStamp;
QueryPerformanceCounter(&qwTimeStamp);

REFERENCE_TIME rtCurrentTime;
pMediaSeeking->GetCurrentPosition(&rtCurrentTime);

LONGLONG llTimeInSeconds = rtCurrentTime / 10000000; // Convert to seconds
LARGE_INTEGER qwPerformanceFrequency;
QueryPerformanceFrequency(&qwPerformanceFrequency);
LONGLONG llPerformanceCount = qwTimeStamp.QuadPart;
LONGLONG llPerformanceCountPerSecond = qwPerformanceFrequency.QuadPart;
LONGLONG llPerformanceCountInSeconds = llPerformanceCount * llPerformanceCountPerSecond;
LONGLONG llTimeInPerformanceCount = llTimeInSeconds * llPerformanceCountPerSecond;
LONGLONG llPerformanceCountRelativeToTimestamp = llPerformanceCount - llPerformanceCountInSeconds + llTimeInPerformanceCount;

In this code, qwTimeStamp is the current QueryPerformanceCounter timestamp, and pMediaSeeking is the IMediaSeeking interface obtained from the output pin of the video capture filter.

First, the GetCurrentPosition method is called to get the DirectShow timestamp in reference time (100 nanosecond units). The timestamp is then converted to seconds by dividing by 10,000,000.

Next, the QueryPerformanceFrequency function is called to get the frequency of the performance counter, which is the number of counts per second. The llPerformanceCount variable is set to the current QueryPerformanceCounter value, and llPerformanceCountPerSecond is set to the frequency of the performance counter.

Finally, the relative timestamp in QueryPerformanceCounter counts is calculated by converting the DirectShow timestamp to performance counter counts and subtracting the number of counts that have elapsed since the start of the performance counter. The result is llPerformanceCountRelativeToTimestamp, which is the relative timestamp in QueryPerformanceCounter counts.

I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any more questions.

Alright thanks! I'm not totally sure if that's right but I have lots of keywords to search now :)

You're welcome! Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help with. Good luck with your project!
