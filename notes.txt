zlib ??

for some reason needed aux_util and aux_vive to worky. disturbing.

don't really care about how to get hand tracking models, just needs to work.

todo:
figure out why aux_vive requires zlib, remove if necessary

figure out how to not compile psvr/psmv/t_kalman along with rest of aux_tracking. make an aux_tracking_psmv?
make those depend on if the psmv driver is active?

steamvr.vrsettings unnecessary

"Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/SteamVR/bin/win64/vrpathreg.exe"

vrpathreg may not have been enough - might need

```
	"external_drivers" : 
	[
		C:\dev\ht_windows_steamvr_2\out\build\x64-Debug\steamvr-monado\"
	],
```

in openvrpaths.vrpath

oh wait no vrpathreg added that for us :P hmm yep it 10% did

ok so.... wat?
